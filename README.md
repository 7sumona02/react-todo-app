## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   pnpm (recommended) or npm or yarn

### Detailed Setup and Running Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    Open your terminal and use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/7sumona02/react-todo-app.git
    ```

    This will download all the project files into a new directory named `react-todo-app`.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    Use the `cd` command to navigate into the newly created directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-todo-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    This project uses `pnpm` as its preferred package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

    Once `pnpm` is installed, run the following command to install all the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    This command will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessary packages into the `node_modules` directory.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables (Optional):**

    The weather widget likely requires an API key.  If so, you'll need to obtain one from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.  Add the API key to this file:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
    ```

    **Important:**  Never commit your `.env.local` file to your repository.  It should be added to your `.gitignore` file.

5.  **Start the development server:**

    To start the development server, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This command will start the development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser.  You can usually access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Using the Application:**

    *   **Adding a Task:** Type your task into the input field and press Enter or click the "Add" button.
    *   **Completing a Task:** Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete.
    *   **Deleting a Task:** Click the "Delete" button (usually an "X" icon) next to a task to remove it.
    *   **Changing Theme:**  Look for a theme toggle (usually a sun/moon icon) to switch between light and dark themes.
    *   **Weather Widget:** The weather widget will display the current weather information for a default location (or a location you can configure, depending on the implementation).
